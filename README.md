# Project Outline

This git hosts data, code and supplementary material for our study on Yeast Gene Duplicate Positional Preference.

["Distinct chromosomal niches in the genome of S. cerevisiae provide the background for genomic innovation and shape the fate of gene duplicates"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.26.482092v2)

## Summary 

In this work we explore the way genomic innovation may be promoted in particular regions of a eukaryotic genome, modulated by chromatin constraints and regulatory flexibility. Through the study of two types of gene duplicates (Small-scale, SSD and whole-genome, WGD) in various 

describe a clear partitioning of a gene-dense unicellular eukaryote genome into regions with variable potential for genomic innovation through gene duplication. Our findings point towards an architectural segregation of function, regulation and evolvability in the yeast genome, which, buffered by chromatin, creates preferential "niches” for gene duplicates and thus more permissive environments for genomic innovation. 

Given this work’s originality, the breadth of the discussed concepts and the possible implications it may have in the fields of genome evolution and synthetic biology, we believe that it will appeal to the readership of Nucleic Acids Research and we are thus very glad to submit it to your consideration.
